Estimating demand for heating systems

## Description
In this project I estimate demand for five different types of heating system. I create a multi-product system of demand and I adopt a "Characteristic-Space" conception of a product. This is viewing heating systems as the sum of their various characteristics. In this case the characteristic is price - the cost of installation and the annual cost of operation. I used multinomial logit and nested logit to form my estimates.

### Application
To demonstrate the usefulness of this type of discrete choice modeling of demand, I predict the change in demand for a more efficient heating system if the government were to provide a subsidy for individuals choosing that system.
